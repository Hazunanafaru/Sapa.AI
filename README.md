This is Machine Learning Development branch

10/05/21/a : Make ml-development branch

12/05/21/a : Creating a machine learning model using self-made violation-complaint-dataset to classify texts into complaint classes. Adding an ipynb file containing experiments of many different NLP approach to solve the problem. Decided to use the lowermost approach, which is using pretrained language model in bahasa Indonesia, followed by layers of neural network to do classification task. This approach resulting a low loss value and having high F1 score. Also, when we do an inference to the model, it gives us an intuitive result. Finally, the model is exported in .h5 format.

14/05/21/a : First version of our classification model to classify reporting texts into 8 classes. Loss is pretty low, the prediction result is also intuitive enough

18/05/21/a : This commit add an .ipynb file containing our process in developing speech recognition (speech-to-text) machine learning system, which is then considered the development to be dropped as the regulation permit us to use google automatic speech-to-text as long as we create another original model.

29/05/21/a : Tidy up some folders
