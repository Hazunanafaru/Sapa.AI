12/05/21/a : Creating a machine learning model using self-made violation-complaint-dataset to classify texts into complaint classes. Adding an ipynb file containing experiments of many different NLP approach to solve the problem. Decided to use the lowermost approach, which is using pretrained language model in bahasa Indonesia, followed by layers of neural network to do classification task. This approach resulting a low loss value and having high F1 score. Also, when we do an inference to the model, it gives us an intuitive result. Finally, the model is exported in .h5 format.
